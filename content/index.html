            So this is a talk about Javascript and Games.

            But I better let you all know that while I'll be picking through some Javascript Game Engines - and there are some beauties out there right now - this talk is mostly a story about a journey that ended up with Javascript and Games.

            Those of you that know me may have been mildly surprised to see me up here - since I spend my days writing Ruby mostly, some Objective-C and not a lot in the way of Javascript (it makes me leave semicolons everywhere). Also, I'm a middleware and serverside guy, with about as much design pzazz as, well, let's make it close to none and move on.

            programming. how does it work?
          </p>

          <aside class="notes">
              A while back I managed to put aside software and alcohol for a bit and had a family. The resulting small humans are accelerating through time at a frightening pace and I want to give them the tools to kick ass as early as possible. The Art of Programming is, I humbly submit, one of those skills.

              We'll get to the Javascript and Games in a little while, don't worry.

              There's a saying "it's not fun until you are good at it, and you don't get good unless you practice". The piece of the puzzle that keeps you going through the non-fun times is motivation, curiousity, an urge to be different, perhaps even boredom.

              I went back to my own motivations to see what I could re-construct in the present day.

              I wasn't a sporty kid. I'm the eldest, and usually very happy with my own company. Being around people for long periods of time tires me out. Typical introvert. Messing with computers was pretty much perfect for me. 

              The smaller humans I have at home are fiendish sports participants - rugby, gaelic football, hurling, olympic handball, basketball, swimming, karate. The love hanging out with their buddies. NOT ME AT ALL. Yikes.

              At this point in time, however, they both have GitHub repos.

              Let's talk about Python. And about CoderDojo.

            <h2>Making Games, #0 : Python</h2>
            <p><image src="images/noun_project_9369.svg"></p>
            <p>games are a common language for humans</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              I brought small human[0] to the CoderDojo in The Science Gallery. I actually had to supervise the release of hordes of plague-flea-infested rats in a number of South County Dublin suburbs so that I could get tickets. That's the kind of dedication parenthood can teach you.

              In that CoderDojo, we did the monkey-see, monkey-do approach to programming - grab a working piece of code, and twitch it about, learning by your mistakes. NOT STRUCTURED. But just to show that YOU CAN CHANGE THINGS. You have power. With power comes confidence. We started off with a game. It was a text game with two caves, one of which has a dragon in. Small human[0] was unimpressed. So we added another dragon. But it was still text. So I downloaded pygame and researched frantically while small human[0] was put to work doing 8-bit art for sprite sheets. At the end of the session, we had an admittedly shite game with shite but personally hand-crafted graphics for achievement.

              I was ready to smash everything in sight with hammers. My teeth were ground down to nubs. I am not patient.

              But I had one level of motivation - making games. This shouldn't have been a surprise. That's exactly what I wanted to do too. And having visualized a game, I then learned how to make it. Back in that antediluvian period that meaned learning your local computer assembly language to do smooth bitwise screen scrolling. So you learned more, and found out how much more you could do.

              That's Games. They are a language for humans.

              While I was on the train home with small human[0], we designed an 8-bit 2D spritey game with a Rugby theme. And small human[0] uttered the fateful phrase "ok - how do I share my game with my friends?"

              Getting his buddies to install Python wasn't going to work for this I'm afraid.

              It turns out, though, that sharing the game was his strongest motivation.

              Let's talk about iPhones. And about Cocos2D.

            <p>humans appear to have deep urge to increase social capital with sharing</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              iPhones and iPod touches are prevalent among the peers of small human[0]. The concept of 'app' is strong in this generation. That's a viable sharing vector, I thought, perhaps we can eke out some success on this platform.

              So. It turns out Objective-C is not a good language to put in front of a child to learn. I would go so far as to say don't bother teaching a kid a compiled language. Teach them to program first, then attempt to destroy their souls later.

            <aside class="notes">
              Given that, Cocos2D is pretty good for techniques - we learned tiled maps, we learned overlays and how to put in obstructions, how to produce pickups, different types of terrain, and got our 2D cartesian coordinates bedded in.

              But the programming wasn't really kicking in. I despaired a little bit, since small human[0]was becoming more and more let down with the lack of results. 

              Let's talk about Javascript.

          <aside class="notes">
            At this point, you may be asking yourselves why it took me so long to get here as Javascript is a totally obvious bloody solution that I should have done ages ago. It works in the browser, which is shareable. It can be embedded in phone, which is also shareable. Well. Two things for me I guess - lack of fluency in the language, and ignorance of the operation of the language in the browser were the bumps, plus being unable to ditch the prejudice I have that the DOM is the stupidest programming model ever.
            
            I started looking at Javascript Game engines. The first one that I got into any depth with was Impact.

            <aside class="notes">
              You may be familiar with this one already. It's a for-pay item - $99. It's moderately straightforward to produce simple games. 

              Downside to this is on the iOS devices - slow as der cucumber

              But. There's a solution for that.

              Ejecta is like a Browser without the Browser. It's specially crafted for Games and Animations. It has no DIVs, no Tables, no Forms – only Canvas and Audio elements. This focus makes it faster.

              JavaScript code is executed directly by a JavaScript VM (JavaScriptCore), the HTML5 Canvas API is implemented in native code with OpenGL, Audio is implemented with OpenAL. Several other APIs (touch, accelerometer, localStorage) behave like those in a real browser.

              WOW.

              Abstracts away the headaches of getting going with 3D in the browser. With it you can create cameras, objects, lights, materials and more, and you have a choice of renderer, which means you can decide if you want your scene to be drawn using HTML 5's canvas, WebGL or SVG.

              This has turned out to be the sweet spot for small human[0..1]. Check out the examples here

              oscar: wrapped a jpg around a sphere geometry
                
              tiernan: bouncing camera

              This is totally the right thing for them - instant results. Shareable in browser. Canvas and WebGL renderers. The WebGL breaks my laptop.

              Of course, given the internet, there are things that are built on this.

              Let's talk about Voxels.

              So you should be seeing some HTML text here. This is an implementation of a Three.js icosahedron rotating on two axes. If you don't
              see anything rotating with a reduced alpha, change the code, maybe introduce a space or something. A few seconds later, refresh should 
              cause the graphic to appear.

              ERMAHGERD.

              voxel.js is a collection of projects that make it easier than ever to create 3D voxel games like Minecraft all in the browser.

              It was written by @maxogden and @substack, two non-game developers that want to make voxel games easy, fun and modular. If you find bugs it is because we don't really know what we are doing. The good news is that 100% of the code is on Github so we hope you will fork it.

              Ok so look at what these guys have built or caused to be built here. Motivation is all about free.
              Sticks to the unixy principles of tiny tight focussed modules, which is a core factor of the node.js style of building systems. 

              if humans[0..1] saw this, then they would just disappear into it :)
